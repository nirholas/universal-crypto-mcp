Copy-paste ready thread (post each section as a separate tweet):

**Tweet 1 (Hook):**
```
I just gave Claude access to 15 blockchains and 330+ crypto tools.

Now I can ask it to:
• Check my portfolio across all chains
• Execute swaps on any DEX
• Analyze DeFi yields
• Scan tokens for rug pulls

Here's how 🧵
```

**Tweet 2:**
```
The problem: Managing crypto across L1s and L2s is a nightmare.

• 10 different block explorers
• 5 different DEX interfaces  
• No unified portfolio view
• Manual everything

Solution: One AI that does it all.
```

**Tweet 3:**
```
Universal Crypto MCP connects Claude/ChatGPT/Cursor to:

✅ Ethereum, Arbitrum, Base, Polygon, Optimism
✅ BNB Chain, Avalanche, Fantom, zkSync
✅ Linea, Scroll, Blast, Mode, Mantle
✅ Solana, TON, XRP Ledger

All with one config.
```

**Tweet 4:**
```
What can you do with it?

"Check my ETH balance on Arbitrum"
"Swap 100 USDC to ETH on Base"  
"What's the best yield for stablecoins?"
"Is this token a honeypot?"
"Bridge 50 USDC from Ethereum to Base"

Claude just... does it.
```

**Tweet 5:**
```
Setup takes 5 minutes:

1. git clone github.com/nirholas/universal-crypto-mcp
2. npm install && npm run build
3. Add to Claude Desktop config
4. Start chatting

```

**Tweet 6:**
```
The 330+ tools include:

💰 DeFi: Swaps, lending, staking, yields
🌉 Bridges: Cross-chain transfers
📊 Data: Prices, charts, indicators
🔒 Security: Honeypot detection, audits
⛓️ On-chain: Balances, txns, contracts

All through natural language.

**First Comment:**
```
Hey Product Hunt! 👋

I built this because I was tired of:
- Switching between 10 different block explorers
- Copy-pasting addresses across dApps
- Missing opportunities because manual processes are slow

Now I just tell Claude what I want and it handles the rest.

Happy to answer any questions about the tech, security considerations, or roadmap!
