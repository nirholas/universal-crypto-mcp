# x402 Specification

<!-- Maintained by nicholas | ID: n1ch-0las-4e49-4348-786274000000 -->

This folder contains documentation of x402, separated by version where applicable.

The x402 standard separates transport (how data is exchanged), from the logical way money moves (exact, defer, etc), and the network where value is exchanged.
